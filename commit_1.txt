After that based on suggestions from mentors, we decided to create BASE LINE of project first.
We did brainstorming on how our system should work, what features it requires etc. We have desided to work on 2 models. 
1. Job Recommendation 
2. Skills Recommendation 

As of now we have a rough idea of system model, we have note it down on paper. Now we are starting with coding on dummy data.
