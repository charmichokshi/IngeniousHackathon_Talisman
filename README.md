Hiring process involves manpower for filtering right candidates, and this process is time consuming. We aim to improve the recruiting process by automating the search of best candidates for particular role based on candidates' skills and experience. We also design recommendation engine for candidates to recommend best CV and best company for them. Machine learning algorithms will be applied to generate efficient recommendations.
